# Comparing CBIR Techniques


This project aims to explore and evaluate the performance and accuracy of various Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) techniques. The focus lies on comparing traditional methods and advanced deep learning approaches to understand their effectiveness in retrieving relevant images based on content.

Traditional Feature Extraction Techniques:

Color Histograms: Utilizes the distribution of color intensities to represent image content.
Local Binary Patterns (LBP): Captures patterns based on local texture information within an image.
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG): Describes the distribution of gradients in different orientations within an image.
Deep Feature Extraction:

ResNet (Residual Networks): Investigates the performance of a deep learning architecture known for its ability to handle complex features through the use of residual blocks.
Text as a Feature:

Explores the integration of textual information as a feature for image retrieval, investigating how combining image content with associated text can enhance the accuracy of retrieval systems.
